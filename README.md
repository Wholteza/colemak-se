# colemak-se
_The Colemak keyboard layout adapted for the Swedish language._

---

The Colemak layout was originally created by Shai Coleman in 2006 as an ergonomic and modern keyboard layout, bringing together the comfort of Dvorak while retaining a lot of QWERTY familiarity. It employs a home row centric design placing frequently used keys under the strongest fingers. While the original layout is optimised for the English language, its Germanic roots also make it suitable for use when writing Swedish.

## Scope
* Colemak-se aims to bring a Swedish language adaption of Colemak to any and all modern computer operating systems. 
* The base layout targets 102-key keyboards, as these are the by far most widely used in Sweden. 
* Colemak-se makes as few key changes as possible in order to ease the often brutal learning process.

Currently, only MacOS and Windows keyboard layouts are available. Linux support and QMK files are under development. Any pull requests with new implementations are greatly appreciated!

## Layout

#### ÅÄÖ-placement
Colemak-SE does not provide full ÅÄÖ parity with QWERTY. The 'Ö-key' has been moved up a row to where the 'P-key' is on QWERTY, to make room for the default Colemak placement of the 'O-key'.

## Installation

#### MacOS
Keyboard layouts in MacOS are installed either on a user or system level.

Alternatively, a '.dmg' disk image is provided for easy GUI based installation. System restart is still required for the layout to show up in 'Input Sources'. Note that this method will install the keyboard layout on a system level.

#### Windows
